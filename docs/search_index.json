["introduction.html", "2 Introduction", " 2 Introduction The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT, (Fu et al. 2012)) mission will join the fleet of earth observation satellites upon its launch in 2021. Thereafter it will begin its mission of monitoring the world’s oceans, lakes, reservoirs, wetlands, and rivers, providing some #### GB per day of information to the scientific community. This information, including height, slope, and spatial extent of inland water features, will be distributed in various data products, and used for a variety of scientific purposes. The river component of this survey will measure state variables including width, slope, and elevation relative to geoid on rivers whose average width is over 100m. This information will become publically accessible datasets with expected applications including discharge estimation in ungaged basins (Durand et al. 2016; Gleason, Garambois, and Durand 2017), data assimilation with hydraulic models (Andreadis 2018; Oubanas et al. 2018), #### River measurements will be aggregated to data products at multiple spatial scales to produce estimates of river height, with, spatial extent, surface slope, and discharge. Because these measurements are often combined probabilistically with other data sources–e.g. prior distributions in Bayesian discharge estimation (Durand et al. 2014; ???), or hydrodynamic models in data assimilation (Andreadis 2018; Oubanas et al. 2018)–SWOT data products will contain uncertainty estimates associated with measured variables. The measurements and the associated uncertainty estimates are derived from physics-based equations that relate the quantities of interest to known and directly measured quantities including satellite position, radar range, power, and interferometric phase. Validation of SWOT data products and underlying processing pipelines is an ongoing effort, the culmination of which will come only after the satellite is in orbit. The first 3 months of the SWOT mission will be devoted to instrument calibration and processing validation (cal/val), employing a fast-sampling orbit wherein the revisit time for certain cal/val sites will be ~1 day (####). This sampling will coincide with field surveys generating in-situ comparison datasets. In order to benchmark instrument performance prior to launch, a fixed-wing aircraft-borne instrument, termed AirSWOT, was developed to produce data analogous to the SWOT satellite (Altenau et al. 2017; Tuozzolo et al. 2019; Pitcher et al. 2019). While this effort was successful in demonstrating the ability for SWOT to measure slope and water surface elevation, the many differences between the airborne and spaceborne missions (e.g. look angle, swath size) preclude this data from being used to validate of uncertainty models, which to date remain largely unverified. Validation is challenging for several reasons. Uncertainty is accumulated from a multitude of sources including…, and assessing each component’s contribution to overall error is difficult. Errors are dependent on a variety of factors that vary within and between rivers on a range of temporal and spatial scales, requiring validation data that are both finely detailed and wide-ranging (encompassing a variety of SWOT rivers). In order to be useful for refining uncertainty estimates, a validation of uncertainty models should be predictive of error magnitude using only a set of SWOT-observable or a-priori variables and applicable to cases outside of those used in the validation study. In this study we present a validation of SWOT measurement uncertainty at the river node and reach scales. The products of this validation are threefold. First, we quantify the degree to which empirical distributions of measurement errors match modeled uncertainty across all validation data. Second, we describe and quantify discrepancies between empirical and theoretical error magnitude as a function of several characteristics including number of pixels/nodes, viewing geometry, and layover characteristics. Finally, we develop, calibrate, and validate a model for refining a priori uncertainty estimates using only information available from SWOT and a priori measurements. For the purposes of validation “truth” we employ simulated SWOT observations from several intensively modeled rivers spanning a range of hydraulic regimes, flow geometry, and catchment topography. We conclude with a prognosis for scaling up this validation as more data–simulated and real–become available. We envision this validation framework–particularly the model–being deployed as an additional postprocessing layer used to empirically scale uncertainty estimates within the SWOT river data products.
